## Optional folder

You may create this folder and include a `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.JPG`, or `.JPEG` that is used by `stopstarter.py` to update streams it creates, using the file as the livestream thumbnail.

If you include multiple jpeg files in the folder, then each time the script will randomly select one of them.
